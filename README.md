# Simple Twitch Bot

 A simple python Twitch Bot, made for the Raspberry Pi, using https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-twitch-bot/ as a guide.
 
 Looking for assistance on how to add additional code/commands to bot. 
 
If using bot, replace credentials in "config.py" with your own. 
Run Bot: "python3 ./main.py" in command line under bot's directory.
